    <h1>Visiting Scotland!</h1>
    <h3><em>Bucket List Trip:</em></h3>
    <p>Visiting Scotland was on our family's <b>bucket list</b>, so to celebrate graduation from grad school, my husband and I planned the trip of a <em>lifetime</em>. 
        We rented a car to get the full experience and stayed in various regions of the country. We also took a ferry to visit one of our favorite islands, 
        and did a bus tour to visit a scenic island in Northern Scotland as well. Here's a snapshot of what we did and <u>we can't wait to return!</u></p>
